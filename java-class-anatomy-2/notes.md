# Some conventions:

1. All .java files should respect PascalCase convention, example:

"MyClass.java" and "HelloWorld.java" are following PascalCase convention.
"myClass.java, my_class.java, Myclass.java, etc.." is not following PascalCase convention.

That's a really good practice to mantain this rule in our projects.

- Obs: All class names follow the same convention, please pay attention for that!


2. Every .java file should have their first class named as well as their name, example:

If my file are called "MyClass.java", my first class should be:

`public class MyClass {

}`

following conventions.
