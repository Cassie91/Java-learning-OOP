# Some conventions:

1. All .java files should respect PascalCase convention, example:

This format indicates the first word starting with uppercase, then the following words having an initial uppercase letter too. Ex: Calculator, MyColor, YourName, etc...

- Obs: All class names follow the same convention, please pay attention for that!


2. Every .java file should have their first class named as well as their name, example:

If my file are called "MyClass.java", my first class should be:

`public class MyClass {

}`

following conventions.

3. Variables should use camelCase convention.
